# CICD Jenkins Example - A sample continuous integration continuous deployment pipeline

*Note: _This is a simple example.  Something more complex might be needed_*

## Key Expectations

The CICD pipeline is needed to deliver content after checking.  The pipeline picks up the changes, builds them, runs unit tests and functional tests, deploys, and finally runs integration tests.

## Change List

2. 02-26-2020 Andy - Added the first pipeline entity.
